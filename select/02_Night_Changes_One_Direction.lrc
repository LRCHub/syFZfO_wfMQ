[00:08.24] Going out tonight, changes into something red
[00:12.62] Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
[00:16.23] Everything she never had, she's showing off
[00:37.73] 
[00:24.01] Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
[00:28.64] She's headin' for something that she won't forget
[00:32.18] Having no regrets is all that she really wants
[00:55.18] 
[00:40.21] We're only getting older, baby
[00:44.48] And I've been thinking about it lately
[00:48.88] Does it ever drive you crazy
[00:52.15] Just how fast the night changes?
[01:08.15] 
[00:56.74] Everything that you've ever dreamed of
[01:00.69] Disappearing when you wake up
[01:04.64] But there's nothing to be afraid of
[01:08.01] Even when the night changes
[01:12.79] It will never change me and you
[01:28.29] 
[01:20.15] Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
[01:24.72] He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
[01:28.22] Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
[01:54.72] 
[01:36.04] Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
[01:40.88] She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
[01:44.24] Having no regrets is all that she really wants
[02:07.24] 
[01:52.58] We're only getting older, baby
[01:56.64] And I've been thinking about it lately
[02:00.74] Does it ever drive you crazy
[02:04.19] Just how fast the night changes?
[02:20.19] 
[02:08.70] Everything that you've ever dreamed of
[02:12.75] Disappearing when you wake up
[02:16.74] But there's nothing to be afraid of
[02:20.31] Even when the night changes
[02:24.84] It will never change me and you
[02:40.34] 
[02:40.26] Going out tonight, changes into something red
[02:44.65] Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
[02:48.05] Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost
[03:15.05] 
[02:54.20] We're only getting older, baby
[02:58.46] And I've been thinking about it lately
[03:02.60] Does it ever drive you crazy
[03:06.29] Just how fast the night changes?
[03:22.29] 
[03:10.86] Everything that you've ever dreamed of
[03:14.68] Disappearing when you wake up
[03:18.77] But there's nothing to be afraid of
[03:22.02] Even when the night changes
[03:26.62] It will never change, baby
[03:30.67] It will never change, baby
[03:34.66] It will never change me and you
